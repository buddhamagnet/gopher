Working examples of common [Go gotchas](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/)

In most cases, we include a program that will fail to compile and
a working example, and note where Go tooling or a robust development setup would help prevent or mitigate these issues.
